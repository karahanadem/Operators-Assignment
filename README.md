# Operators Assignment

## Employee Class with Operator Overloading

This console application demonstrates the use of operator overloading in C#. It includes:

1. An `Employee` class with `Id`, `FirstName`, and `LastName` properties
2. Overloaded equality operators (`==` and `!=`) that compare employees based on their `Id` property
3. A demonstration program that creates employee objects and compares them

### Key Features

- Operator overloading for equality comparison
- Proper implementation of `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` methods
- Detailed comments explaining each part of the code
- Demonstration of how operator overloading works with different objects

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have .NET 6.0 SDK or later installed
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

### Code Structure

- `Employee.cs` - Contains the Employee class with overloaded operators
- `Program.cs` - Contains the main program that demonstrates the functionality
